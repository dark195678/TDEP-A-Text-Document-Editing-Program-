# TDEP-A-Text-Document-Editing-Program-
This is a simple text editor that I hope to make like word, this is being made with python.

This first version isn't much, just a editor like notepad which comes installed with most new installs of windows, I plan to add basic formating and a spell checker soon, the first version is also named DarkPad as a place holder name but all other versions will be named TDEP.

I am new to coding so new versions will be slow to come but I will try to get new updates to come out when I have the time.

Please let me know how the editor looks and what I could change to make it better.
